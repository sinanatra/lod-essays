Combining the allegory of the [Five Senses](10614) with genre scenes and also with family portraits finds its precursors in Dutch painting. For example, the [portrait of the siblings of Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg](209) was painted at another German court as early as 1637.The children are depicted in an interior room, the open window affording a view of the Braunschweig Burgplatz with the Braunschweig Lion and the so-called “Mosthaus”.
### Portrait of siblings
The painting [“The Five Senses”](159) from the Modebild Collection shows the five children of  [“Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg”](9499).
From left to right can be seen: [“Eva Christina”](9390) as [“auditus”](10613) (hearing) with a lute, 
[Anna Magdalena](9499), as  [visus](10536) (seeing) with a [mirror](10946), [Maria Juliana](), as [tactus](10586) (feeling) with a bird pecking into the hand, [Joachim Albrecht]() as [Gustus](10913) (tasting) with an apple and [Heinrich Friedrich]() as [Odoratus](10917) (smelling) with a flower. Thus this is a portrait of a sibling combined with an allegory of the five senses. This is unique in the oeuvre of the painter [Joachim Georg Creuzfelder](9350). In this portrait of siblings, the young Hohenlohe court painter combines the common iconographic sign inventory of the allegory of the Five Senses with a family portrait. Creuzfelder chose a simple assignment of five sense attributes to one portrait each, in which no biographically based assignment pattern can be read.
